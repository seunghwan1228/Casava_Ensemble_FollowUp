# Casava_Ensemble_FollowUp
--------------

<br/><br/>

Implementation of a Casava Ensemble Model from scratch

Using "Ensemble" is the most important technique to 🚀 accuracy

Here is simple example for mnist ensemble

<br/><br/>

## [Mnist-Ensemble-Test](https://github.com/seunghwan1228/Ensemble-Testing/blob/master/For_ensemble_testing.ipynb) 

The testing `git-hub-link` is mnist for 

:one: RandomForest

:two: DNN

:three: CNN

-----------

1. Create Data Utilties 
    - Data Download
    - Data preprocessing
    - Data Augmentation

2. Create Config to manage variety architecture
    - Each architecture includes differenct config

3. Train Each Architectures
    - Each model should be stored with model config and data config

4. Try do "Ensemble" with following the 1st solution

5. Create Pipeline as consider as Operation perspective

6. Create Demo Pages with web page

7. Create Docker File to test the repository
